# Snake Water Gun Game (Python)

## Description
This project is a simple Snake–Water–Gun game developed using Python.
It was created to practice basic programming concepts such as conditions,
loops, and user input.

## Features
- User vs computer gameplay
- Random choice generation
- Result calculation based on game rules

## Technologies Used
- Python 3

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run the program:

'''
1 for snake
-1 for water
0 for gun 
'''
import random
computer = random.choice([-1, 0, 1])
youstr = input("Enter your choice: ")
youDict = {"s": 1, "w" : -1, "g" : 0} 
reverseDict = {1: "Snake", -1: "Water", 0: "Gun"}
you = youDict[youstr]

print(f"You chose {reverseDict[you]}\nComputer chose {reverseDict[computer]}")

if(computer == you):
    print("It's a draw") 

else:

    if(computer == -1 and you == 1):
        print("You win!")

    elif(computer == -1 and you == 0):
        print("You lose!")

    elif(computer == 1 and you == -1):
        print("You lose!")

    elif(computer == 1 and you == 0):
        print("You win!")

    elif(computer == 0 and you == -1):
        print("You win!")

    elif(computer == 0 and you == 1):
        print("You lose!")

    else:
        print("Something went wrong")
